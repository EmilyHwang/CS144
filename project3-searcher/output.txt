     [java] ItemId: 1044884674 Description: TITLE: Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi-Dark Lords of the Sith ISSUES: #1-6 (The complete mini-series!!) WRITERS: Tom Veitch & Kevin Anderson DESCRIPTION: This series was released by Dark Horse Comics in 1994. It revealed the bloody origin of the Sith and their eventual rise to power as an enemy of the Jedi. It's a well told story and should not be missed by any Star Wars fan. All the comics are individually bagged and boarded and range in condition from near mint to mint (the "fuzziness" seen in the photo is due to poor lighting and is NOT a defect on the comics themselves). SHIPPING/PAYMENT: They will be shipped through the Post Office with delivery confirmation which will be paid for by the buyer (cost will vary depending upon location of buyer).

     [java] ItemId: 1046633965 Description: Dark Knight Strikes Again # 1 Batman New Click Images to Enlarge BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN #1 First Printing. In 1986, a groundbreaking miniseries took the industry by storm, revolutionizing forever the way people envisioned the comic-book medium. Now acclaimed writer/artist Frank Miller is set to do it again, with the most anticipated comics sequel of all time... THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN. It's been three years since the events of THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, and everything is just fine. Perfect, in fact. At least on the surface. What the world at large doesn't know is that it's a total sham. A perfectly choreographed, pretty little world where everything that's ugly, or even potentially disturbing, is all nicely wrapped up with neat little ribbons and swept under the carpet. Only he knows better. He's watched it fester to near-breaking point, and it's time for the only free man left who can effect any real change to bring it all down around their ears, once and for all. It's not gonna be pretty. But at least it'll be honest. The Dark Knight returns once again -- trimmer, more streamlined, and with a vitality that hasn't been seen since the first years of his war on crime. Together with his army of Bat-soldiers, including Carrie Kelley -- formerly Robin, and now the new Catgirl -- the Dark Knight wages a new war on a diseased world that's become completely lost. But to fight this war successfully, he must first return to being the World's Greatest Detective and discover what has become of his former allies who were once the World's Greatest Heroes. THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN will be told in 3-parts -- each issue a whoppin' 80 pages in Prestige Format -- masterfully written and illustrated by Frank Miller and featuring the magnificent colors of Miller's collaborator, Lynn Varley.

     [java] ItemId: 1046740686 Description: Step onto Desilu Stage 9 with Robert H. Justman! Profiles in History's Once in a Lifetime Experiences presents Dinner with Robert. H. Justman! What Star Trek fan wouldn't jump at the chance to spend an evening with one of the most beloved figures in Star Trek History? One very fortunate bidder will have that chance. The esteemed Mr. Justman needs no introduction to Star Trek fans, but here is an opportunity to spend a private evening with a true gentleman, a charming conversationalist, a genuine insider and a font of Star Trek knowledge, at one of the most "in" spots in LA - the famous Wolfgang Puck restaurant - Spago's Beverly Hills If you are the high bidder, you and a guest will be flown to Los Angeles where your personal Towncar awaits you. You will glide in luxury up the famous 405 freeway and down Sunset Boulevard, through Beverly Hills and into the heart of Hollywood, where your room at the grand old historic Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel has been reserved. This is the true Grande Dame of Hollywood - the site of the first Academy Awards Presentation and the glamorous gathering place of the biggest stars in Motion Picture History. Here, you will have time to relax, and freshen up before you meet Mr. Justman and his gracious, elegant wife for dinner. Your Towncar will drive you to Spago's where the food is the exquisite and the clientele exclusive. This is a unique and very limited opportunity to ask the questions you've always wanted to ask, discuss the subjects you want to discuss - and experience the luxury of a private dinner with a Star Trek legend. Of course Jamie Lee Curtis or Billy Crystal just might be at the next table. But you'll probably be so engrossed in Mr. Justman's tales and anecdotes (not only of Star Trek but his many, many other shows) that you won't even notice. When your dinner is over - your Towncar awaits to return you to your hotel, or to explore LA Nightlife on your own. The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel is across from the Chinese Theater, convenient to Universal Studios, the Sunset Strip, and other major attractions, and only one block from the brand new entertainment & shopping Complex, Hollywood and Highland! Be the first to go where no fan has gone before - into the private life of this distinguished and beloved repository of Star Trek lore. This item is one of more than 500 pieces of Star Trek memorabilia, all from the collection of Star Trek Art Director Matt Jefferies, Executive in Charge of Production Herb Solow and Producer Bob Justman.

The grades you see are extremely accurate. (Read what the buyer of a $1000.00 AF 15 recently said about our scan"Slightly better than appeared on the scan. A+" -nov 28 2001 feedback, or just to confirm read the Dec 3 2001 feedback of a VF Green Lantern purchase;". Better than described. A+++++ THANKS ";OR read what a buyer of a nm Thor said"Pinpoint grading (an ebay rarity!) Recommend this seller.Dec 3 2001)).All grades are guarenteed within 0.5 of any grading service. The grade quoted above is an accurate grade reflecting the true condition of the book.The price is set so that you will be hard pressed to find as good a deal anywhere else.(This 33% bigger scan( than the books' actual size) magnifies and enlarges defects-it is like looking at the book through a magnification factor). Generally speaking the book possess's a solid intact spine with no splits;staples solidly in place;corners sharp;gloss and color deapth vivid,deep and close to new in appearance;only minor spine stress marks may exist( often similar to thoses produced at original printing);overall a glossy off white to white paged copy offered at an unbeatable initial bid. As we have a large multiple grade inventory of Silver and Golden age books,many will be offered for sale in coming ads.There are many comics being auctioned off on Ebay this week.Combine auctions to save postage.THOUSANDS of other books are still to come including most Marvel and DC titles from 1950 up.Use the BUY IT NOW feature to end the auction and lock out the competition.(Note; on some multiscan auctions we are not able to offer the buy it now feature) We are multiple CBG award winners;EBAY Power sellers;and have 1000 total positive feedbacks(many multiple) since we began here about 2 years ago.Some may remember us for our full page Marvel adds starting in the 1980's.Our Marvel and DC inventory is extensive and often stocked in multiple conditions form the 1950's up...Note.All our scans are "High resolution".That means a magnified, extremley detailed scan which is about 33% LARGER than the actual size of the comic.( so, of course, defects appear about 1/3rd bigger,than if you were viewing the item right in front of you)..Why do we do this?Why do we want the comic to have all the defects OVERSTATED? Here are the reasons; 1)All defects are CLEARLY seen.(in our opinion a small scan is of no use-the grade can be anything). 2) By revealing all defects,you can grade based upon what you like or dislike about a book. 3) No two grades have the same defects,thus a large scan allows you to delineate the key aspects of the book. 4)A large scan will OVERSTATE defects.Defects appear LARGER than what you will see when you get the book.(This applies especially to creases(thicker than actual),and stress marks,and to a lesser extent to color tones,which may show gradations in color not visible with the naked eye).Most of our customers note that the book is nicer when it arrives than what this scan revealed(reasons;the scans bright flood light reveal evey single microscopic impact point,plus defects appear 33% larger.) 5)All our books are guaranteed to be in the same general grade range(within+/- 0.5) if the book is slabbed(within 14 days of purchase) 6) Full exchange privledges on any item purchased.within 7 days. 7) Shipping : Cost; 5.00 for less than 5 comics(priority mail with delivery confirmation) in North America NOTE ;Allow 2 weeks for material to reach you;we often beat that,but increased security screening by the post office can delay shipping time;we take full responsibility.... ..Questions and/or comments?

Nice 8 X 10 B&W glossy photo of actress JANET MUNRO in shorts and halter top. British actress Janet Munro was the daughter of a stage comedian who, during World War 2, was in charge of the RAF entertainment unit. Janet's popular on British TV of the 1950s was such that one prominent fan magazine, responding to public demand, voted her "Miss Television of 1958". Signed by Disney in 1959, Janet played spirited ingenue roles in Darby O'Gill and the Little People (1959), Third Man on the Mountain (1959), Swiss Family Robinson (1960) and The Horsemasters (released to American television in 1961 and to European theatres shortly thereafter). Once away from the Disney orbit, Janet radically altered her screen image with a string of sexy, fallen-woman roles; her final film assignment was as the fading alcoholic pop star in Sebastian (1968). Her success in show business was in sharp contrast to her extraordinarily unhappy private life, which included two failed marriages to actors Tony Wright and Ian Hendry and two miscarriages. Janet Munro collapsed and died at age 38, reportedly choking to death while drinking tea. The official cause of death is listed as acute myocarditis. _ Hal Erickson PLEASE READ: I do not utilize at this time the optional "checking out" feature displayed on my item description page by EBAY.

     [java] ItemId: 1495561434 Description: Cat Ballou (1965) Oscar Winner LEE MARVIN Sig Vintage autograph acquired during the golden age of Hollywood! Signed, with brief inscription, on a sheet measuring approximately 4 _" x 6"; removed from the pages of a vintage autograph book. In very good condition. *OWN A PIECE OF HOLLYWOOD HISTORY* NO RESERVE. GUARANTEED AUTHENTIC Lee Marvin Date of birth 19 February 1924, New York, New York, USA Date of death 29 August 1987, Tucson, Arizona, USA. (heart attack) Biography for Lee Marvin[? Height 6' 3" Mini biography Prematurely white-haired character star who began as a supporting player of generally vicious demeanor, then metamorphosed into a star of both action and drama projects. Born in New York City to Lamont Marvin, an advertising executive, and his wife Courtenay, a fashion writer, the young Marvin was thrown out of dozens of schools for incorrigibility. His parents took him to Florida, where he attended St. Leo's Preparatory School near Dade City. Dismissed there as well, he enlisted in the U.S. Marines at the beginning of World War II. In the battle of Saipan in June 1944, he was wounded in the buttocks by Japanese fire which severed his sciatic nerve. He was invalided home and got menial work as a plumber's apprentice in Woodstock, New York. While repairing a toilet at the local community theatre, he was asked to replace an ailing actor in a rehearsal. He was immediately stricken with a love for the theatre and went to New York City, where he studied and played small roles in stock and Off-Broadway. He landed an extra role in Henry Hathaway's U.S.S. Teakettle, and found his role expanded when Hathaway took a liking to him. Returning to the stage, he made his Broadway debut in Billy Budd, and after a long succession of small TV roles, moved to Hollywood, where he began playing heavies and cops in roles of increasing size and frequency. Given a leading role in Eight Iron Men, he followed it with enormously memorable heavies in The Big Heat and The Wild One. Now established as a major screen villain, Marvin began shifting toward leading roles with a successful run as a police detective in the TV series 'M Squad'. A surprise Oscar for his dual role as a drunken gunfighter and his evil, noseless brother in the Western comedy Cat Ballou placed him in the upper tiers of Hollywood leading men, and he filled out his career with predominantly action-oriented films. A long-term romantic relationship with Michelle Triola led, after their breakup, to a highly publicized lawsuit in which Triola asked for a substantial portion of Marvin's assets. Her case failed in its main pursuit, but did establish a legal precedent for the rights of unmarried cohabitors, the so-called "palimony" law. Marvin continued making films of varying quality, always as a star, until his sudden death from a heart attack in 1987. Spouse 'Pamela Feeley' (18 October 1970 - 29 August 1987) (his death) 'Betty Ebeling' (February 1951 - 5 January 1967) (divorced) Trivia Says he learned to "act" in the Marines, trying to act unafraid during ferocious combat, which brought him a Purple Heart during invasion of Saipan. The body of Lee Marvin was interred next to that of Joe Louis in Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Va. USA. Son Christopher born 1952. Daughter Courtenay born 1954. Daughter Cynthia born 1956. Daughter Claudia born 1958. Was a direct descendant of both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Was Spielberg's first choice for the role of Quint in Jaws (1975). Personal quotes "Tequila. Straight. There's a real polite drink. You keep drinking until you finally take one more and it just won't go down. Then you know you've reached your limit." Upon accepting his Best Actor Academy Award for "Cat Ballou," 1966: "I think half of this belongs to a horse somewhere out in the valley." Biography from Leonard Maltin's Movie Encyclopedia: Rugged actor who, like many tough-looking leading men, started his movie career as a heavy, then graduated to heroic roles w

     [java] ItemId: 1495864333 Description: STAR TREK Boxed set of Star Trek movies Perfect Christmas Present for your favorite Star Trek fan!! Six movies including: Star Trek--The Motion Picture: The crew of the Enterprise is reunited to combat a lethal force field headed toward Earth. Slow, talky, and derivative, somewhat redeemed by terrific special effects and majestic Jerry Goldsmith score; still, mainly for purists. Network and videocassette version--generally considered an improvement--runs 143m. Followed by many sequels--and several new TV series! Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan: Kirk and the Enterprise crew must do battle with the nefarious villain of 1967's ``Space Seed'' episode. A bit hokey and pretentious at times, but a likable adventure overall, with nice touches of warmth and humor. Footage added for network showings. Originally released without the ``II'' in its title. Star Trek III: The Search for Spock: Picking up where #2 left off, Kirk reassembles his crew and shanghais the Enterprise to try and rescue Spock--in whatever form he may still be alive--while both he and the rapidly destructing Genesis Planet are endangered by a Klingon warship (led by Lloyd, in an ineffectual performance). Subdued sci-fi outing very much in keeping with tone of the original TV series... and therefore, recommended most heartily to Star Trek fans. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home: The Enterprise crew takes a sharp left turn toward comedy in this uncharacteristic--and very entertaining--movie. Story has the familiar characters time-traveling back to the 20th century in order to save the Earth of the future, with the help of some humpback whales. Sheer novelty of the comic tone excuses some forays into the obvious; it's all in fun. Star Trek V: The Final Frontier: The Enterprise crew takes off on an emergency mission when an apparent madman takes over a distant planet and holds its interstellar ambassadors hostage; his motives, however, turn out to be anything but terroristic. Dramatically shaky trek starts off with a case of the cutes, and gets worse before it (finally) gets better. A weak entry in the series. Shatner's feature-film directing debut; he also shares story credit. Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country: The Enterprise crew is assigned to negotiate truce with Klingon leader, only to fall prey to a trap set by one of his renegade cohorts (Plummer, in a deliciously flamboyant performance). Entertaining saga cowritten by director Meyer. Nimoy helped concoct the story and also executive produced. Video version has 2 minutes of additional footage.

     [java] ItemId: 1495959768 Description: ROMANCING THE STONE: One Reviewer Wrote: "Director Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Contact) had a hit with this 1984 comedy that first teamed Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner, and Danny DeVito. Turner steals the show from the guys, however, playing a pushy romance novelist who gets stuck among some dangerous figures in Colombia and has only a rumpled guide (Michael Douglas) as an ally. The chemistry between the stars is infectious (the trio went on to make a sequel, Jewel of the Nile, and then an interesting, dark comedy directed by DeVito, The War of the Roses). Zemeckis--whose specialty at the time was creating set pieces of raucous action (as in his Back to the Future)--keeps things hopping with lots of kinetic material. " Star Trek First Contact (c)1996 PG-13 111 Mins Starring: Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, James Cromwell previous rental. Synopsis: They call themselves the Borg - a half-organic, half-machine collective with a sole purpose: to conquer and assimilate all races. Led by their seductive and sadistic queen (Alice Krige), the Borg are headed to Earth with a devious plan to alter history. Picard's last encounter with the Borg almost killed him. Now, he wants vengeance. But how far will he go to get it? The Jewel of the Nile (1985) ( USA NTSC VHS Movie ) More thrilling comedy and hilarious adventure in "Romancing the Stone''s" hit sequel. Here Kathleen Turner, Michael Douglas and Danny DeVito find themselves in the middle of an Arabian revolution and must locate the mysterious "jewel."

METRO GOLDWYN MAYER PRESENTS THE WIDESCREEN PRESENTATION QUIGLEY DOWN UNDER STARRING TOM SELLECK LAURA SAN GIACOMO ALAN RICKMAN ROGER EBERT, Chicago Sun-Times: "'Quigley Down Under' stars Tom Selleck, an actor who with his height, authority and natural ease might have been a major Western star in the old days. "I admired Alan Rickman's performance as the villain. He has a polished grace that serves here to suggest evil dimensions just beneath the surface. "I also enjoyed, in a visceral way, the pleasures of seeing the visual beauties of a Western. The choreography of a gunfight in rocky foothills. The excitement of a chase on horseback. The ambushes and close calls and treks through the desert land. "'Quigley Down Under' is a handsome, well-acted film." TODD GORMAN, StarFilm Reviews: "Quigley Down Under is a very pleasant surprise. Essentially it_s a Western with Tom Selleck as the eponymous hero who takes himself to the Australian Outback like a cowboy Crocodile Dundee in reverse. There is an offbeat quirky love story too. "With his neatly trimmed beard, cowboy hat and huge six-foot rifle, Quigley cuts a very imposing dash when he steps off the boat in Western Australia. "It_s the 1860s and he_s been hired after answering a newspaper advertisement looking for _the best long-distance sharpshooter in the world_. "This is a hugely enjoyable film with all kinds of traditional heroic resonances. "An authoritative Selleck is wholeheartedly into his role as a laconic but highly moral Western hero. "Lots of spectacular rugged landscapes, an uplifting musical score and some perfectly judged dramatic moments complete a movie which manages to be very entertaining."

     [java] ItemId: 1496416098 Description: Here are four classic '60s episodes of four different TV series hosted by four fab British gal singers! First is a segment of Dusty Springfield's BBC TV series, with guest stars Tom Jones (who performs "Show Me" and duets with Dusty on another number), and Scott Walker in what is probably his first solo (post-Walker Brothers) TV appearance, singing "Mathilde" (from his first solo album). Dusty herself performs "Get Ready," "All I See Is You," "Nowhere To Run," an Irish folk song, and "Everybody Needs Somebody To Love." As one of the few extant segments of Dusty's TV series, this episode was heavily excerpted in the French and Saunders "Full Circle" special in 1994................. Next is an episode of Lulu's series, with guest stars the Everly Brothers; they perform "Bye Bye Love," and duet with Lulu on "Walk Right Back." Lulu serves up the Judy Garland chestnut "The Trolley Song" (made famous again in the 80s on Saturday Night Live by the Sweeney Sisters). Also featured is the dour British comic Les Dawson; he, too, sings a duet with Lulu!............. Then, a segment of Cilla Black's show, with guest stars Sandie Shaw and Cliff Richard, each performing a Eurovision winner; Sandie seems uneasy as she runs through "Puppet on a String," while Cliff enthusiastically glides through "Congratulations." Sandie also sings the Bee Gees number "Words," and Cliff does a duet with Cilla. And, of course, Ms. Black opens the show with her John Lennon-Paul McCartney-penned theme song "Step Inside Love" ............... Finally, an episode of THE SANDIE SHAW SUPPLEMENT, with guest star John Walker of the Walker Brothers (who performs "By The Time I Get to Phoenix"). Sandie sings "Route 66," "Do You Know The Way to San Jose," and "Girl Don't Come," and a duet with John Walker on "Homeward Bound." ............ AND, as if THAT weren't enough, the tape is filled out with bonus 60s TV appearances by all four of the aforementioned divas. Total running time is just about two hours. Buyer pays shipping.

     [java] ItemId: 1496709072 Description: Jack grew up in Illinois and was a circus acrobat at the age of 8. He would work his way up to aerialist with two circuses and also appear at the 1934 World's Fair. Jack then went to New York where he found work as a male model. Hollywood was his next stop and he entered films in 1938 as a bit player and stuntman. In 1940, at the suggestion of producer 'Eddie Small', Jack changed his first name to Clayton. He would appear in 'B' movies and serials through 1942. After the war, he would return to these supporting roles while concentrating on westerns. By 1949, he was playing the masked man, but that man was Zorro in Ghost of Zorro (1949). Clayton was hired to appear in the Television version of the popular radio show called "The Lone Ranger". One of the things that he had to do was to work on his voice so that he sounded like the radio Lone Ranger. When he got that right, he would become famous, along with Tonto, on the small screen. Clayton was "The Lone Ranger" from 1949 to 1952 until he was fired in a salary dispute. Along with Hop-a-long Cassidy, Clayton was one of the most popular Television western stars at the time. He was replaced by actor John Hart (I), but Hart's tenure was terminated after one season. It was during this time that Clayton would return to the big screen to enhance his movie career with such memorable movies as Radar Men From the Moon (1952) and Jungle Drums of Africa (1953). Hired back, at a higher salary, Clayton would be the Lone Ranger until the series ended in 1957 after 169 episodes. Clayton would appear in two color big screen movies, Lone Ranger, The (1956) and Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold, The (1958). After a lifetime of 'B' movie parts, Clayton found success in a Television Series and he would continue to make commercials and personal appearances as "The Lone Ranger" for the next three decades. At his appearances, Clayton would preach the Ranger's Code of good behavior which he also practiced as his image would never be tarnished with the scandals that affected other big stars. In 1975, Wrather Corporation, which owned the Television series and the rights to the title character, got a court order to stop Clayton from appearing in public as "The Lone Ranger". They planned to film a new big screen movie of the popular hero and did not want the public to confuse it's new star with the old one. After the film flopped, Clayton was given permission to again appear as "The Lone Ranger". You are bidding on a black and white 8-by-10-inch photo, autographed by Clayton Moore in black ink. The inscription reads, _Regards: Clayton Moore. The Lone Ranger 12/25/85._ This piece is in excellent condition and will make a great addition to any Clayton Moore fan_s collection. This autograph comes with a Certificate of Authenticity from Steven S. Raab Autographs. Steven S. Raab Autographs is one of the nation's premier dealers in autographs, manuscripts, signed photographs and documents.

MIKE BRACKEN, EOpinions: "Caligula is an odd juxtaposition of disparate images. In any given scene, the viewer can see actors of the stature of [Malcolm] McDowell, Helen Mirren (who plays Caesonia, Caligula_s wife), and Peter O_Toole surrounded by hordes of unabashed couples. "Even by today_s standards, Caligula is a strong film guaranteed to offend the squeamish: a castration (fed to hungry dogs), numerous decapitations, disemboweling, and so on. This was the old Rome as depicted in ancient texts. "It_s also a movie that_s guaranteed to become one of my guilty pleasures. It_s hard not to like McDowell_s gratuitous performance as he capers around the film_s elaborate sets carrying on like a madman. Not to mention, any film that features such copious amounts of both togetherness and bloodletting is bound to make my cult favorites list." DANIEL KRAUS, Salon: "Today the notorious 1979 film remains the only major motion picture to couple respected, eminent film actors (Gielgud, Peter O'Toole, Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren) with no-holds-barred Roman decadence. "The 20th-anniversary edition of Caligula may be digitally remastered and enhanced with Dolby stereo sound, but at its core it is as raw as ever." TLA FILM & RADIO GUIDE: "For those chagrined at having missed the decadence and excess of the Roman Empire, this epic is as satisfying as a massage by Michelle Pfeiffer." M. CHRISTER, 100 Must See, ViolentVision: "I really think Tinto Brass is up there with the best of the Italian directors. "The film is epic, has enormous settings, lots of extras and is as long as these movies tend to be. As a historical drama Caligula works fairly well, but it's the scenes involving the Romans' decadence that really hit the spot. What in previous films only could be suggested, is here shown in full detail. It is a film that should be seen by anyone that likes Italian film. "You like historical pictures? "See it! "You like Helen Mirren, Malcom McDowell and other English stars? "See it! "You like Tinto Brass, John Steiner and Adriana Asti and other Italian stars? "See it! "You curious about the extremes of man's nature. "See it!" DIALOGUE Caligula (Malcolm McDowell): I have existed from the morning of the world and I shall exist until the last star falls from the heavens. Although I have taken the form of Gaius Caligula, I am a man unlike no man and so I am a God. Caligula: Let them hate me, so long as they fear me! ANCIENT ROME LIVES!

Paul Simon - The popular singer-songwriter runs afoul of the law while performing "Scarborough Fair" with Miss Piggy and joins the Muppet band for a rollicking "Loves Me Like a Rock." Raquel Welch - The international sex symbol goes prehistoric to sing and dance with a giant spider and teams with Miss Piggy for a show-stopping "I Am Woman" (W-O...P-I-G!)."_ DVD 3 Harry Belafonte - The calypso legend performs his classic hit "Day-O", tries to out-drum Animal, and joins a chorus of African-masked chanters for his uplifting "Turn the World Around." Linda Ronstadt - The pop star battles Miss Piggy for Kermit's affections, in between performing some of her smash hits - including "Blue Bayou" and When I Grow Too Old to Dream." John Denver - John organizes a camping trip, watches his garden grow "Inch by Inch", gives Gonzo some helpful advice, and joins the cast in "Grandma's Feather Bed."_ DVD 4 Peter Sellers - The chameleon-like actor turns into a demented gypsy violinist, plays a very strange doctor on "Veterinarians' Hospital", and joins a temperance band.

Carol Burnett - The queen of comedy does some light cleaning, sings a romantic polka, demonstrates why she "was Made for Dancing", and performs her "Lonely Asparagus" sketch. Gilda Radner - The Saturday Night Live star duets with a giant carrot, gets caught in a sticky situation at Muppet Labs, and becomes very attached to the cast while she taps her troubles away._ DVD 7 George Burns - Gonzo fiddles while George Burns outwits a tabloid reporter, croons classic tunes from vaudeville days, and - backed by harmonizing Muppets - serenades M
     [java] ItemId: 1496935966 Description: The Glass Bottom Boat is hardly a high point in the careers of star Doris Day and director Frank Tashlin, though it is a better-than-usual example of that pure-1960s genre, the "spy spoof." Day plays Jennifer Nelson, a PR worker at NASA in Florida. She also doubles as a "mermaid" for her father Axel (Arthur Godfrey), the skipper of a glass-bottom tourist boat. While garbed in her skimpy mermaid costume, she has a run-in with handsome space technician Bruce Templeton (Rod Taylor). Through a series of misunderstandings, Bruce is led to believe that Jennifer is an enemy spy, determined to steal scientific secrets. Several other characters enter into the plot, including bumbling secret agent Julius Pritter (Dom DeLuise) and prissy security chief Homer Cripps (Paul Lynde). Also on hand are TV favorites Dick Martin as Jennifer's erstwhile beau and Eric Fleming as a man of mystery. A few cute celebrity cameos round out this ribtickler, while Doris Day, as always, gets a few opportunities to sing. DELUXE LETTER-BOX EDITION. Color/1 hour 50 minutes.

     [java] ItemId: 1496978129 Description: THE TRUCE ~ By Francesco Rosi Awarded DVD NEW This is an Original Official Released DVD. All code region 0 NTSC DVD playable on any DVD players Director: Francesco Rosi Cast : John Turturro, Rade Serbedzija, Massimo Ghini, Stefano Dionisi, Teco Celio, Roberto Citran, Claudio Bisio Dolby Digital Sound / Letter Box / In Original English with Chinese Subtitles / 117 mins The Odyssey of an Italian Jew from Auschwitz to his Home This film had won the Audience Award Best Feature of 1997 Sao Paulo International Film Festival, Best Director, Best Film and Best Producer of 1997 David di Donatello Awards. Italian chemist turned author Primo Levi was interred at Auschwitz during WW II until 1945. Following his release, he returned to his native Turin and penned the wrenching autobiographical account of life in the concentration camp If This Is a Man. In 1962, he wrote a companion book, The Truce, a chronicle of his hellish nine-month journey from the camp to Turin. Both books are crucial entries in the history of the Holocaust. This careful adaptation of the second book took filmmaker Francesco Rosi 10 years to make. Levi's trek begins when shortly after the Germans leave, four Russian horsemen ride up and tear down the gates of Auschwitz. Levi is quickly aboard one of the first outbound trucks. Over the next few months, he goes to many different countries, and along the way he meets and is befriended by assorted fellow travelers. Through them, his appreciation of life and freedom slowly returns, but with it also comes a deep rage and an abiding guilt at having survived, a guilt that may have led Levi to suicide in 1987.

But with her loveliness and genius went an enigmatic contradiction of character that could lead only to tragedy. Olga Spessivtzeva's mental collapse in 1940 was followed by her detention for twenty-two years in the Hudson River State Hospital, New York, almost f_rgotten by the world and those who had hailed her as the successor t_ Pavlova. To a great extent those lost years must remain unwritten, but Anton Dolin, who as an unknown youth first saw Spessivtzeva from the wings, paints a very moving picture of her development as a dancer, her triumphs throughout the world and her relationship with such giants of the ballet world as Fokine, Lifar and Lopoukhova, as well as himself. In unfolding the story of this great Russian star he also makes many be]_i -the-scenes revelations and recritates some of the finest ballet of our time. Ma nificently illustrated, ~~ 9 The Sleeping Ballerina is a book to enrapture anyone with an interest in the arts. THE AUTHOR Anton Dolin needs no introduction as one of the world's finest ballet dancers. The only British male dancer to star with Diaghilev's Russian Ballet, for whom he created many leading r_les, he was principal dancer with the VicWells Company from 1931-35 and founded London's Festival Ballet in 1949, guiding it for twelve years. The author of several books, including a biography of Alicia Markova, he now devotes himself to choreography, which enables him to combine his favourite recreation, travel. i. ///////////////////// \\\\\\\\\\\\ Hello and welcome : I try to always list similar items or collections at the same time so check my other auctions for possibly more items like this one !

They will make someone very happy Christmas morning! Happy Holidays, and God bless. Take a look at our new website! Link below! Mexican lobby cards are larger (12.50 x 16.75) and often more colorful and action-packed than other lobbies. They usually come in a set of eight, with brightly colored artwork and a black and white inset photo which varies from card to card. These are actual, theater used posters. They come from a collector friend whose mother-in-law worked for a film distributor in M_xico City. She saved the ones she liked, and stored them carefully. They are a historical treasure today! Here's a wonderful Jane Powell item! It's a mini poster from Mexico, probably meant to be a calendar top, with Jane all dalmationed out. A good size 11.74 x 14.5 inches. Sweet and a bit campy--Jane looks great! Take a look at all my auctions--where else but at Mexican Memorabilia can you consistently find such a high percentage of unusual, quality collectibles you never see anywhere else? If you have trouble seeing my photos, please drop me a line and I will e- them out to you. CONDITION: Very light wear, two small tack holes!_See Photo!

Lobby cards, movie-related displays and promotions? Advertisements? We've got all kinds of stuff, from the teens to the 60's.

The James DeMonaco/Kevin Fox screenplay follows an accused man who is forced to commit crimes in order to prove himself innocent of murder. After Chicago police hostage negotiator Danny Roman (Samuel L. Jackson ) succeeds in rescuing a little girl menaced by her gun-wielding dad, he's praised by both the police department and the media, and he returns to his usual cop routines with his longtime partner, promising his new wife Karen (Regina Taylor ) he'll make it home for dinner every night. Then his partner, who had evidence of embezzlement within the police department, is killed. Since Danny arrives at the crime scene only seconds later, he's the main suspect, and Chief Al Travis (John Spencer ) asks him to turn in his gun and badge. Danny invades the Chicago Internal Affairs Division headquarters and tries to get the truth from Inspector Terence Niebaum (J.T. Walsh) while holding two assistants and Commander Frost (Ron Rifkin) as hostages. He then calls for an outsider from another precinct, hostage negotiator Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey ). When Sabian arrives, the two compete for control, while Danny attempts to prove to him that he's been falsely accused. The film is dedicated to J.T. Walsh, who died not long after the production wrapped. ~ Bhob Stewart, All Movie Guide I love Harry Potter Matrix Star Trek cell hobbit lord of the rings star wars

Gorgeous 8 X 10 color glossy photo of actress BARBARA EDEN. An Arizona native, actress Barbara Eden was three years old when her family moved to San Francisco, where as a teenager she plunged into acting and singing classes at San Francisco State College's Conservatory of Music. After briefly working as a band singer, Eden took up residence at Hollywood's Studio Club, an inexpensive rooming house for aspiring actresses. Other Studio Club residents would note in later years that Eden would look at the club's bulletin board and apply for every show business job available, even those that she was advised would "ruin" her career. Persistence paid off, and in 1956 Eden made her film debut in Back from Eternity. She worked steadily in television, finally attaining leading-lady status on the 1958 sitcom How to Marry a Millionaire, in which she played a myopic "Marilyn Monroe"-type golddigger. Good film and TV roles followed for the lovely blonde actress, and full stardom arrived with the NBC comedy series I Dream of Jeannie. Eden played the curvaceous bottle imp from 1965-70, reviving the character in a brace of TV movies, the last one produced in 1991. Eden's post-Jeannie career has included several films, TV guest star appearances, theatrical and nightclub engagements, and still another sitcom, 1981's Harper Valley P.T.A. _ Hal Erickson PLEASE READ: I do not utilize at this time the optional "checking out" feature displayed on my item description page by EBAY.

     [java] ItemId: 1497650226 Description: You are bidding on the VHS movie of "Beau Travail", starring DENIS LAVANT (the star of "Lovers on the Bridge"), MICHEL SUBOR (star of "The Little Soldier") and GREGOIRE COLIN (of "The Dreamlife of Angels" fame). The film was masterfully directed by CLAIRE DENIS, who has directed several terrifc films including "Nenette et Boni", and "Contre L'Oubli". Based loosely on Herman Melville's novella, "Billy Budd", this film tells the story of an ex-Foreign Legion officer, Galoup, as he recalls his once glorious life, leading troops in the Gulf of Djibouti. His existence there was happy, strict and regimented, but the arrival of a promising young recruit, Sentain, plants the seeds of jealousy in Galoup's mind. Galoup feels compelled to rid the troop of Sentain, especially after Sentain becomes the object of affection of the High Commandant, who Galoup greatly admires. Ultimately, Galoup's jealousy leads to the destruction of both Sentain and himself. This film is worth seeing just for the final scene in which the reserved Galoup gets spastic! This video is in the French language with English subtitles. The video was once a rental but it is in excellent condition. It comes in its original box and there is a rental sticker affixed to the videotape. The video is in the NTSC format so it will play in all North American VCRs. Synopsis: This simmering drama is an exploration of moral and social values. Filled with implied eroticism, it's a rumination on the bitter predicament of a man stewing in petty jealousy that turns to murderous hate. It's a beautiful film to watch as it captures the drills and training regimens of shirtless, muscular young men as forms of dance. The focus is on a troubled sergeant, Galoup (Denis Lavant), and his irrational dislike for a raw recruit, Gilles Sentain (Gregoire Colin), whom he sees as an untrustworthy misfit. For his part, Sentain is entirely dutiful. But the sergeant is poised to destroy him in a classic struggle of good and evil. The film's vision of military men devoted to meaningless tasks, and constantly preparing for combat with an unseen enemy, is haunting, as is the resentment of the sergeant cast out from the tight community of the lesser ranked. His commander is Bruno Forestier (Michel Subor), a brooding careerist who has lost all sense of military purpose.

"It fires the imagination and touches the heart"- Rex Reed "At the Movies" This movie stars: Academy Award Winner Jodie Foster Mark Harmon Blair Brown Jonathan Silverman Harold ramis William McNamara John Shea Directed by Steven Kampmann Synopsis: For ex-ballplayer Mark Harmon, whose drive never matched his big league prospects, the high point of his life was summer of 64'. Decades later, He returns home to recall the past - and the person who made it special (Jody Foster). Harmon and Foster star in Stealing Home , a bittersweet story "beautifully written a la Moonstruck " in which "you'll spend a couple of hours lost in a wonderful world." As a burnout seeking redemption, Chicago Hope's Harmon hits the mark as the older Billy, and the luminous Foster sparkles as Kate, the friend and mentor who vibrantly draws the loose end of Billy's past and present together. Buoyed by a marvelous golden-oldies soundtrack, Stealing Home is a warm, wistful memory-lane journey.

     [java] ItemId: 1498114581 Description: This VHS video is The Buddha of Suburia. His father said "Pursue the path to happiness" ~ Karim took the road to sex, drugs and rock 'n roll. At the heart of this urban adventure is the coming of age story of Karim, son of an assimilated Indian businessman in London. When his Zen-obsessed father becomes a star guru of the swinging suburban scene, Karim is swept up into a world of theater, art, drugs, rock 'n' roll and sexual exploration. But, in the tradition of Kureshi's other acclaimed films, "Sammy and Rosie Get Laid" and "My Beautiful Launderettes," Karim must also wrestle with his sense of identity as an Indian, as an Englishman, and as a man. It may not be enlightenment, but it sure is awakening! Starring Naveen Andrews, Brenda Blethyn and Roshan Seth and winner of seven international film awards, it's a high energy flashback that captures the spirit and excitement of this magical era in perfect pitch. This video is new and in the original shrink wrap. This movie is in color and is 220 minutes long. The movie is from BBC Video. It is a two volume box set.

I've used a very detailed,sterling, man in the moon face with a pave finish,(little rhinestones to make it sparkle!)with little Crystal dangles as the centerpiece. The necklace is all wireworked in sterling for durability ,using 3 sizes of the hottest new color of Swarovski Austrian crystal,Tanzanite, a rich periwinkle/violet.

     [java] ItemId: 1676483026 Description: This is a really versatile Tommy Hilfiger skirt in a size 5. The color is magenta or pinkish purple, not flaming purple as it looks in the photos (I apologize for the photo quality!). The material is a 100% cotton waffle weave with a drawstring waist.

Length is 11.5 inches. The waist is stretchy and yes, the drawstring is real, not one of those fake ones, so even if your girl's waist is skinny, she'll fit into this just fine.

     [java] ItemId: 1677127264 Description: This is a really cute Tommy Hilfiger long sleeved top. The tag says it's a size 3T, but it fit my girl like a 2T. No rips, stains or holes. But I had to bleach the collar to clean it and so it's white with blue stitching instead of baby blue in color. Looks totally natural though~ can't tell that it used to be baby blue in color. The front has one embroidered Tommy logo star on it with a baby blue and a silver star embroidered on each side of that. My favorite part is the the edges are kind of ruffly, they call it lettuce edging, makes it look really cute around the bottom and the sleeves. It also has baby blue around the bottom and the sleeves. The left sleeve also has an embroidered red, white and blue logo star on it. The back snaps up 3 times down from the nape for easy on and off the head. Cute top! Made of 100% cotton.
